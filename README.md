# By Haowl

This project is my final project as part of my course with Nology. My project is a full stack project and the readme of my byHaowl-api will detail the installation process.
This project is created via react, java and a database(specifically mysql). 
The final project is a e-comerce wesite selling candles and ceramics. It also focuses on mental health and provides users with words of affirmation.

Ensure that in application.properties, the local host port is coherent with mySQL.

### `in mySQL add "CREATE DATABASE byHaowl;
use byHaowl;"`
### `run the program in java`
### `npm start in react`


## Motivation
This project was inspired by my candle business. I wanted to have a more real life application to my final project and thought as I make candles, it would make sense to create a website for it. This is an ongoing project and will constantly be updated post course.
